# nssExercise-temperatureConverter

// ***Instructions***

// Write a program that will convert a temperature from fahrenheit to celsius, or from celsius to fahrenheit.
// In the HTML, have one input field where someone can enter in a temperature.
// Create a radio button group where Celsius or Fahrenheit can be selected as the scale that the number should be converted to.
// Create a block level element that will hold the text of the converted temperature.
// Create a button that, when clicked, displays the converted temperature.
// Create another button that, when clicked, clears any text in the input field.
// Add an event handler to the input field that checks if the user pressed the enter key, and if that happens, perform the conversion.
// If the temperature is greater than 90F/32C the color of the converted temperature should be red.
// If the temperature is less than 32F/0C the color of the converted temperature should be blue.
// For any other temperature, the color should be green.


//***Logic***
//Listen for Click on "Convert Temperature Button"
//Listen for Radio Button selection
//If both entries are valid, convert text input to integer, then to the other temperature scale
//If one or more entries are invalid, alert the user to the error
//Print converted temperature
	//If temperature is greature than 90F/32C, display the converted temperature in Red
	//If temperature is less than 32F/0C, display the converted temperature in blue.
	//Else display temperature in green.
